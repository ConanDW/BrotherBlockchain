# Brother Blockchain ðŸ‘ª
This blockchain will run from 11/11/2019 until 2025 after my brother graduates high school on a firebase server.
This blockchain gets progressivly harder to mine as it increases one value.
The blockchain will then seise to run by increases difficulty to the point where it can no longer mine blocks due to the infeasibility of the difficulty.
## Why did you make this?
I made it for fun and as a personall challenge. It also serves as a time tracker.
### Where can we see this in action?
The blockchain's logs can be seen at 
(https://brotherblockchain.firebaseapp.com)Coming Soon!
#### Credits go to Xavier Decuyper for a base for me to build this off of.
