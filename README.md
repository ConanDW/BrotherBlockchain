# Brother Blockchain ðŸ‘ª
This blockchain will run from 11/11/19 until 2025 after my brother graduates high school on a Digital Ocean server.
This blockchain gets progressivly harder to mine as it increases one value.
The blockchain will then seise to run by increases difficulty to the point where it can no longer mine blocks due to the infeasibility of the difficulty.
## Why did you make this?
I made it for fun and as a personall challenge. It also serves as a time tracker.
This project was developed from early October 2019 until 11/11/19 in my spare time.
### Where can we learn more?
